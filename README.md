## Inspiration
Gaming is usually done with a controller or with a keyboard and mouse. 
But what if we could create a more interactive way of playing video games by only using our hands? In this way, we can reminisce of older technologies like the Kinect and the Wii, move around and do some exercise, and we also offer an economical alternative to expensive and resource-intensive virtual reality devices!

## What it does 
Instead of using a traditional controller, invision employs the user's camera to allow you to play. Map the controls with the hand gestures you would like and quickly start playing with your hands! Our live-generated model will recognize the motions and automatically activate the button you set up!  

## How we built it
- GUI: tkinter
- Hand tracking: Mediapipe
- Hand gestures model: sklearn & pandas 
- Controller emulation: vgamepad 
- Application: Python

## Challenges we ran into
- Trouble mapping the buttons to the hand gestures and make the buttons release 
- Hard time implementing the tkinter functionalities
- Problems with creating the model database and training the model 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team is incredibly proud of our product and the time and effort we put into it. Even though we encountered several problems, we are pleased that we either overcame them or found a method to work around them to produce a functional app. We are also proud of the live-generated model that we created on our own and the various functionalities we implemented.

## What we learned
- tkinter app development
- Mediapipe's hand-tracking model
- sklearn's machine learning models
- Pandas' dataframes
- vgamepad's controller emulation 

## What's next for invision
We would like to add more features such as precise hand movement recognition and improve the current functionalities that we have and make them more efficient.
